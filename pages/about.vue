              Located about two hours drive from Pune, in Satara district, in
              Maharashtra state, on the banks of the river Krishna, it is a
              place where you are alone with God and you can dive into the
              primordial depth of the Spirit. The name Brahmapuri in the yoga
              sastras refers to the seat, sphere, or abode of Brahman and the
              Sahasrara Chakra is also referred to as Brahmapuri. In the
              Markandeya Purana it is described as the city of Lord Brahma,
              situated on the summit of golden Mount Meru, the king of mountains
              and the support of the planet earth in the island of Jambudwipa
              which is the puranic of Indian subcontinent. Also this city
              Brahmapuri is surrounded by the cities of Lord Indra and of seven
              other gods. It is also regarded that these places are subtle in
              nature and so their discovery is not easy....

            Since ancient times yogis have lived and meditated in Brahmapuri. On
            the left river bank one can find Bhavani Nahani - the bathing place
            of Bhavani Devi - and just 30 meters away from it is a very small,
            but vibrational temple of Shri Bhavani. Locals say that the water in
            this bathing place is healing, especially for the skin. Shri Sita
            and Shri Ram stayed in Brahmapuri during their exile when Shri Sita
            used Bhavani Nahani for bathing.

            There is a rock by the side of this Nahani called the Shri Ram Rock.
            Later, Shri Samarth Ramdas (who was an incarnation of Shri Hanumana)
            found in the deep waters of the river Krishna, stone idols of Shri
            Sita-Ram and Devi Anglai. Shri Mataji has Herself explained the true
            meaning of word, namely that Angalai (Angla + Ai) = Mother of Angla
            people (Anglo i.e Westerners), or Mother Mary. She further added
            that since their Mother (Shri Mary) has been here at this place, the
            Western people should come and practice Sahaja yoga here.

            The blissful attention of Shri Mataji to Brahmapuri and Her working
            to find such a location manifested in the early 1970s, when Shri
            Mataji used to visit Rahuri. Finally the place was found and Shri
            Mataji came to Brahmapuri in 1984. At that time, it was a wild
            place, with only one simple house where the Holy Mother stayed, and
            the yogis stayed in the garden. Shri Mataji stayed in Brahmapuri six
            times between 1984 and 1990 along with the Sahaja Yogis from the
            West. She repeatedly stressed, "Brahmapuri is My place‚Äù. Six pujas
            took place at Brahmapuri and many beautiful and divine incidents are
            recalled by the Sahaja yogis who attended these pujas. One puja was
            held directly in the Krishna-river. Shri Mataji was sitting on a
            large rock and yogis were doing puja to Her with the flowing river
            water. During this unique event, the atmosphere around changed and a
            picture of Shri Ganesha appeared on the standing rock. In December
            1990, during the last visit of Shri Mataji to Brahmapuri, yogis
            again worshiped Her by the flowing water at the same place in the
            river bed. The atmosphere was such as if all Gods and Goddesses had
            gathered there to witness this occasion. Once, when Shri Mataji
            arrived in Brahmapuri late in the evening, She asked the yogis to
            listen to melodious sound of Krishna river water and said that was
            Shri Krishna Shakti singing to welcome Adi Shakti.
